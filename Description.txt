This game is inspired by the old snake game, Snake Xenzia. However, this new version has a whole new story and plot behind. 
When starting the game, the player has to move the cursor to move the snake, and at each level, there are different challenges.
At the first two levels, the player has to find the key to open the door to rescue the snake's offspring in the middle of the maze.
And at level 3, the last level, the player has to move the snake to eat the apples because it is tired after a period of finding its offspring.
The last level will end when the snake has eaten 10 apples to reach the development of 100%.
Note that, at the first two levels, the player should try to move the snake not to touch the walls of the maze. 
If the snake touches a wall, the player will lose. It is the same in the last level, if the snake touches the grass while eating apple, the player will lose.
